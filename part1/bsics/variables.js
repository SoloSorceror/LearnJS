const accountId = 1234 //can't change

let accountEmail = "Sanjaychetry@gmail.com"

var accountPassword = "12345"
// has block and functional scope problem, don't use var, use let and const ok!

acountCity = "Sanjay"

// accountId = 2 
// not allowed

//If you declare a variable and leave javascript will treat it as undefined
